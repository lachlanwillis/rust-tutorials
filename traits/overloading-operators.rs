// In Rust many of the operators can be overloaded via traits.
// That is because a + b is syntactic sugar for a.add(b) and the add method is part of the Add trait.
// Therefore the + operator can be used by any implementor of the Add trait.
// A list of the traits, such as Add, that overload operators can be found in core::ops.
